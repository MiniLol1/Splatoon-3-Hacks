# Tutorial how to get any badges on Splatoon 3
!!YOU WILL GET BAN IF YOU DO THIS SO DO IT ON A EMULATOR OR BANNED SWITCH I AM NOT RESPONSABLE IF YOU GET BANNED!!


First you need ToolBox https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox

After you need to dump Splatoon 3 When it's done with Toolbox go to RSDB and open BadgeInfo.Product.600.rstbl.byml.zs then go to this site https://leanny.github.io/splat3/collectibles.html and look for the badges you want and copy the Internal ID of the badges. 

Example: 3101002 Internal ID of X rank Gold badges, once you got the Internal ID pick any badges you have already and just replace the internal ID on the badges you already have like this:
